This repository is for all the games, programs, examples, tutorials written by Chaduke primarily with the Blitz3D Language and LibSGD.  Most of the work has been done in the "engine" folder, however lots of progress has been made on disc golf game and a platformer game which both make use of the functionality of the engine. 

At the moment most of it is in a state of flux, as is LibSGD itself, so expect to find errors and things that simply don't work at all until further notice.

Some may find useful the "beginner" folder as it contains well-commented examples that start from a non-programmer's level and slowly build up in difficulty.  I plan on continuing these as I have the time and if others show interest.

The misc folder contains lot's of simple tests and experiments, much of that code needs to be looked through and updated and a lot of it deleted, but there's also a lot of potentially useful stuff in there as well.
